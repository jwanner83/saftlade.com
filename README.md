# Saftlade.com
This is the code to the official saftlade.com website: https://saftlade.com

Don't judge the code, it was written in two evenings in about 4 hours so there wasn't really much time to refactor
everything. Also, this is my first try with svelte (which I really like).

### Stack
I used literally everything that I wanted and it worked flawless. (Especially pnpm and vite are golden ðŸ¥‡)
